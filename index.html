						<p>The oldest of six living children, Vincent van Gogh was born March 30, 1853, in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands, to a religious family. Forced to leave school early, van Gogh took a job with his uncle as an art dealer in The Hague. After being transfered to London, he suffered a breakdown when his romantic advances towards his landlady's daughter were rejected, and he was fired soon after. He then taught and began preaching at a Methodist boy's school. It was at this time that van Gogh began to consider following in his father's footsteps and becoming a minister. Rejected several times from different religious institutions because he refused to be tested in Latin, he enventually volunteered to preach at a poor coal mine, a place most priests were sent to as punishment. There, he lived a very spartan and zealous life, soon angering the church committees. Finally, he lost his contract.</p>
						<p>After this, in 1880, he moved to Brussels to become an artist, despite having no formal training. During this period he was supported financially by his brother Theo, an art dealer. Theo would continue to support van Gogh until the latter's death.</p> 
						<p>In 1885, van Gogh painted <em>The Potato Eaters</em>, now considered to be his first masterpiece. Despite his confidence in his work, the painting was not well received, as Impressionism, notable for the use of bright, vibrant colors, was the current trend in art. Van Gogh first saw and become inspired by Impressionism while living briefly with Theo in Paris, and began studying with Impressionist painters. However, he alienated many of them due to bickering.</p>
						<p>He then moved to Arles, France, spending money primarily on painting supplies and living on bread and drinking absinthe. It was at this point when he began sipping turpentine and nibbling paint. Concerned for his brother, Theo asked fellow painter Paul Gauguin to watch van Gogh, but the two argued constantly. One night, after a particulary heated argument, Gauguin left. Van Gogh followed with razor, later severing part of own ear and presenting it to a prostitute. Found at home and subsequently submitted to a hospital, he began having terrible seizures. The exact cause of van Gogh's decline in mental health is not known, and there many theories. Released January of 1889, he was soon hospitalized again, although he was allowed to paint outside during day and return to the hospital at night.</p>
						<p>Considered dangerous by the people of Arles, van Gogh moved to Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence hospital. There, he began painting the hospital gardens and entered the most productive working period of his life, producing a torrent of paintings and sketches, among them his most famous work, <em>The Starry Night</em>. After Dr. Paul Gachet agreed to take him on as patient, van Gogh moved to Auvers, twenty miles north of Paris, France, renting a room in town. Able to sell only one of his paintings at this time, Theo urged van Gogh to be more frugal, upsetting van Gogh, who wrongly beleived that Theo no longer wished to sell his work.</p>
						<p>In July 1890, van Gogh went out to paint and shot himself in chest with a revolver. He survived, and after making it back to his room, was found bleeding and taken to the hospital. Theo was sent for and the two spoke over the next two days. Vincent van Gogh died July 29, 1890, in his brother's arms. He last words were said to have been, "The sadness will last forever." Theo, weakened by syphils and his brother's death, died six months later.</p>

						<p>After the death of both brothers, van Gogh's sister-in-law, widow of his brother Theo, began collecting van Gogh's works, and arranged an exihbit of his paintings in March, 1901. From that exhibit, his fame grew, and Vincent van Gogh is considered a genius today, and the greatest Dutch painter after Rembrandt, with several of his paintings ranking among the most expensive in world. He is still influencing new artists to this day, and has been made the subject of songs, films, plays, television shows, and books, including a published collection of his letters.</p>
